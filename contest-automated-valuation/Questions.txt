Program 1
Write a program to find the factorial of two given number
It should be in the given format:
	4 5
	24 120

Problem 2
A website requires the users to input username and password to register. Write a program to check the validity of password input by users.
Following are the criteria for checking the password:
	1. At least 1 letter between [a-z]
	2. At least 1 number between [0-9]
	1. At least 1 letter between [A-Z]
	3. At least 1 character from [$#@]
	4. Minimum length of transaction password: 6
	5. Maximum length of transaction password: 12
Your program should accept a sequence of comma separated passwords and will check them according to the above criteria. Passwords that match the criteria are to be printed, each separated by a comma.
Example
	If the following passwords are given as input to the program:
	ABd1234@1,a F1#,2w3E*,2We3345
	Then, the output of the program should be:
	ABd1234@1

Problem 3
You are required to write a program to sort the (name, age, height) tuples by ascending order where name is string, age and height are numbers. The tuples are input by console. The sort criteria is:
	1: Sort based on name;
	2: Then sort based on age;
	3: Then sort by score.
	The priority is that name > age > score.
If the following tuples are given as input to the program:
Tom,19,80
John,20,90
Jony,17,91
Jony,17,93
Json,21,85
Note: the inputs are to be given using a file(store the inputs to a file named in.pgm3.txt and get the values from it)
Then, the output of the program should be:
[('John', '20', '90\n'), ('Jony', '17', '91\n'), ('Jony', '17', '93\n'), ('Json', '21', '85\n'), ('Tom', '19', '80\n')]

Problem 4
A robot moves in a plane starting from the original point (0,0). The robot can move toward UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT with a given steps. The trace of robot movement is shown as the following:
	UP 5
	DOWN 3
	LEFT 3
	RIGHT 2

The numbers after the direction are steps. Please write a program to compute the distance from current position after a sequence of movement and original point. If the distance is a float, then just print the nearest integer.
Example:
If the following tuples are given as input to the program:
	UP 5,DOWN 3,LEFT 3,RIGHT 2
Then, the output of the program should be:
	2

Problem 5
Write a program to compute the frequency of the words from the input. The output should output after sorting the key alphanumerically.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
	New to Python or choosing between Python 2 and Python 3? Read Python 2 or Python 3.
Then, the output should be:
	2:2
	3.:1
	3?:1
	New:1
	Python:5
	Read:1
	and:1
	between:1
	choosing:1
	or:2
	to:1
