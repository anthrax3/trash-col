popy.py is an encryption-decryption python script based on base64 encoding and decoding using the python module base64.
This is basically a file encryption program. 
Usage : python popy.py <option> <fileName> <key>
<option> : 1 for encryption
           2 for decryption

This encryption is so simple and can be brute forced. Hope no one will spend time for that.
